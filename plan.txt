Current focus, update dropdowns with all current project names and todolist titles:

* the project name dropdown should be updated everytime a project name is stored.
* the names in the dropdown should be able to be clicked and used for submission.
* to simplify being stored, make a new function that checks if the drop down has selected
a option other than new project and return it so it can be called and its return value
can be stored for whatever need it has.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* the todolist title dropdown should be updated everytime a todolist title is stored.
* the title in the dropdown should be able to be clicked and used for submission.
* to simplify being stored, make a new function that checks if the drop down has selected
a option other than new todolist title and return it so it can be called and its return value
can be stored for whatever need it has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* possible make the above two plan sections one function instead of two.

some psuedo script for this plan:
